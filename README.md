# Food Delivery App

Food Delivery App is an Android application developed using Kotlin and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The project utilizes Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit with coroutines for network requests, Room for local data storage, Glide for image loading, and Firebase Authentication for user authentication.

## Architecture üèõ

The application architecture is based on the MVVM pattern, which separates the data presentation logic (Views or UI) from the core business logic of the application.
